        <li>Clown class testimonial
            <p>
                This class sucks and you should never take it! The class made it impossible to hold a job. There are no breaks and I couldn't handle all the homework. The teacher was purposly rude to everyone. The teacher also has never held down a clown reltated job for more than 2 weeks. The tests, which were pulled off the internet, were too hard because we weren't tought the material. Overall would not recommend.

                This class was not good. The class doesn't have any actual training. We just learned about lions and tigers(not part of the class). We didn't learn how to train the aniamls, no technique, nothing.
