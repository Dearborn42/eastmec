            <p>
                "This class sucks and you should never take it! The class made it impossible to hold a job. There are no breaks and I
                couldn't handle all the homework. The teacher was purposly rude to everyone. The teacher also has never held down a
                clown reltated job for more than 2 weeks. The tests, which were pulled off the internet, were too hard because we
                weren't tought the material. Overall would not recommend." -Jim H.

                "This class was not good. The class doesn't have any actual training. We just learned about lions and tigers(not part
                of the class). We didn't learn how to train the aniamls, no technique, nothing. The one time we were actually
                exposed to lions one of my classmates came close to death and was hospitalized because the teacher was apparently
                afraid of lions." -Dwight S.

                "This class was suopernaturally horrid! This class was a joke. All of the stunts were done on a 2ft ramp. We didn't
                even use motorcycles or cars, we used bikes with training wheels and segways. One time when we were training, our
                instructor was absent due to his "cold", but we saw him book a cruise in the Carabbian. The sub given to us was more
                trained than our original teacher and we learned stunts and tricks. The next day we were told to forget everything
                we were taught. At the end of the day, do not take this class." -Stanley H.

                "This class was subpar and unpleasant! We never used a safety net when we parcticed, I don't have enough fingers to
                count how many injuries occured, mainly because I lost one of my hands when I fell into a lion cage while swinging.
                The teacher was terrible because he didn't even have hands. Whenever he tried to exlain how to grip the bars he
                couldn't. We were never shown a demonstration because of his lack of hands, so every stunt we did was based off our
                own interpretations of what was taught. Overall, this class shouldn't be legal and no one should be taking it." -Creed B.

                "This class was unacceptable. The cables attached to the hoops and bars always snapped. The instructor never fixed
                this problem because he never paid attention during pratice. A woman named Julie broke her collar bone because she
                fell and the instructor didn't push the mat under her. When she sued the school, she lost because the instructor
                made us sign a contract that void his responsablility." -Andy B.

                "This class was complete chaos. We weren't taught any tricks because the instructor said that a good magician doesn't
                reveal his tricks. Whenever we presented to him, and we impressed him, he would force us to tell him how to do the
                trick or fail the semester. The animals we used in tricks were rabid, and had rabbies. Some kid was bitten and the
                teahcer didn't do anything. He just said, "Go fix yourself". This class was terrible and never should be taken." -Michal S.
