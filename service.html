        <li>Clown class testimonial
            <p>
                This class sucks and you should never take it! The class made it impossible to hold a job. There are no breaks and I couldn't handle all the homework. The teacher was purposly rude to everyone. The teacher also has never held down a clown reltated job for more than 2 weeks. The tests, which were pulled off the internet, were too hard because we weren't tought the material. Overall would not recommend.

                This class was not good. The class doesn't have any actual training. We just learned about lions and tigers(not part of the class). We didn't learn how to train the aniamls, no technique, nothing. The one time we were actually exposed to lions one of my classmates came close to death and was hospitalized because the teacher was having an affair with a secretary.

                This class was suopernaturally horrid! This class was a joke. All of the stunts were done on a 2ft ramp. We didn't even use motorcycles or cars, we used bikes with training wheels and segways. One time when we were training, our instructor was absent due to his "cold", but we saw him book a cruise in the Carabbian. The sub given to us was more trained than our original teacher and we learned stunts and tricks. The next day we were told to forget everything we were taught. At the end of the day, do not take this class.

        <li>Acrobat class testimonial
            <p>
                This class was subpar and unpleasant! We never used a safety net when we parcticed, I don't have enough fingers to count how many injuries occured, mainly because I lost one of my hands when I fell into a lion cage while swinging. The teacher was terrible because he didn't even have hands. Whenever he tried to exlain how to grip the bars he couldn't. We were never shown a demonstration because of his lack of hands, so every stunt we did was based off our own interpretations of what was taught. Overall, this class shouldn't be legal and no one should be taking it.
